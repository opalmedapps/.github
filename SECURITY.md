# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, we encourage you to report it as soon as possible. Please follow the steps below to report a vulnerability:

1. Do not open an issue on GitHub: Security issues should not be publicly disclosed until they have been addressed. Avoid discussing potential vulnerabilities in public forums such as GitHub issues, forums, or social media.

2. Report the vulnerability to Dr. John Kildea at john.kildea@mcgill.ca. Please include as much information as possible to help us understand the nature and scope of the issue:

    - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
    - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
    - Any relevant screenshots or code snippets.
    - Potential impact of the vulnerability.
    - Any other relevant information.

## Reporting a bug in a third-party libraries

For security vulnerabilities found in third-party libraries, please also contact the library's owner or maintainer directly.

<!--- Additional option to add

1. Should we have our own PGP encryption when sending information to us?
2. Should we add in the "Reporting a Vulnerability" about them reading a vulnerability on a forum or social media? If so, should we ask them to provide us the details so that we can investigate?
