Reporting a Vulnerability

We value security for the project very highly. We encourage all users to report any vulnerabilities they discover to us. If you find a security vulnerability in the Keploy project, please report it responsibly by sending an email to hello@keploy.io

Security / Disclosure

If you find any bug with Renovate that may be a security problem, then e-mail us at: renovate-disclosure@mend.io. This way we can evaluate the bug and hopefully fix it before it gets abused. Please give us enough time to investigate the bug before you report it anywhere else.

Please do not create GitHub issues for security-related doubts or problems.
